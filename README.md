# robohydra-boiler-plate

## Synopsis

This is a basic project to setup a common starting place for robohydra projects.  Robohydra is a snazzy little client testing tool that mocks REST calls.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Spinning up mock services is something that I do quite frequently.  I wanted a Fork & Go solution for being able to vagrant up and get going very quickly.

## Installation

* Feel free to Fork the code
* Clone the Repo
* Install Vagrant & VB or your provider of choice
* Install Ansible locally
* Vagrant up


## API Reference

You'll want to look at the RoboHydra Docs for how to add new plugins for "heads"

## Tests

No test setup yet
